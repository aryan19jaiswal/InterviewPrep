### DSA Preparation Roadmap for MAANG Companies

#### 1. **Foundation: Basic Programming and Math**
Before diving into DSA, ensure you're comfortable with:
- Programming languages: Choose one (Python recommended for interviews due to its simplicity).
- Time/Space Complexity: Big O notation.
- Bit Manipulation: Basics like XOR, shifts.
- Math: Modular arithmetic, prime checks, combinatorics.

**Tips**: Practice on LeetCode or HackerRank. Read "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) for theory.

#### 2. **Core Topics and Questions**
Focus on these topics in order. For each, I've listed 5-10 representative problems from LeetCode (with links). Solve Easy first, then Medium, then Hard. Track your progress on a sheet or app.

- **Arrays and Strings**
    - Easy: Two Sum, Valid Anagram, Longest Common Prefix.
    - Medium: Container With Most Water, 3Sum, Group Anagrams.
    - Hard: Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Trapping Rain Water, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
    - Patterns: Sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums, hashing.
    - Why MAANG? Arrays are in ~60% of problems.

- **Linked Lists**
    - Easy: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists.
    - Medium: Add Two Numbers, Intersection of Two Linked Lists.
    - Hard: Merge K Sorted Lists, Reverse Nodes in K-Group.
    - Patterns: Fast/slow pointers, reversal, merging.
    - Tip: Implement singly and doubly linked lists from scratch.

- **Stacks and Queues**
    - Easy: Valid Parentheses, Implement Stack using Queues.
    - Medium: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation, Daily Temperatures.
    - Hard: Largest Rectangle in Histogram, Sliding Window Maximum.
    - Patterns: Monotonic stacks, parentheses validation, BFS/DFS queues.

- **Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)**
    - Easy: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, Symmetric Tree.
    - Medium: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, Validate Binary Search Tree.
    - Hard: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.
    - Patterns: Traversals (inorder/preorder/postorder), recursion, tree DP.
    - Why MAANG? Tree problems test recursion and optimization.

- **Graphs**
    - Easy: Number of Islands, Clone Graph.
    - Medium: Course Schedule, Pacific Atlantic Water Flow.
    - Hard: Word Ladder, Alien Dictionary.
    - Patterns: BFS, DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), union-find.
    - Tip: Practice on adjacency lists vs. matrices.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Easy: Climbing Stairs, House Robber.
    - Medium: Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence.
    - Hard: Edit Distance, Regular Expression Matching.
    - Patterns: Memoization, tabulation, knapsack, LIS.
    - Why MAANG? DP is crucial; expect 1-2 per round.

- **Backtracking and Recursion**
    - Easy: Subsets, Generate Parentheses.
    - Medium: Combination Sum, Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.
    - Hard: Sudoku Solver, N-Queens.
    - Patterns: Permutations, subsets, N-Queens.
    - Tip: Draw recursion trees to visualize.

- **Heaps/Priority Queues and Hashing**
    - Easy: Top K Frequent Elements, Kth Largest Element in an Array.
    - Medium: Merge K Sorted Lists (heap version), Find Median from Data Stream.
    - Hard: Sliding Window Median, LFU Cache.
    - Patterns: Top K elements, frequency counts.

- **Greedy Algorithms**
    - Easy: Assign Cookies, Lemonade Change.
    - Medium: Jump Game, Gas Station.
    - Hard: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons.
    - Patterns: Interval scheduling, Huffman coding.

- **Advanced Topics (If Time Allows)**
    - Tries, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, System Design basics (for senior roles).
    - Problems: Implement Trie, Range Sum Query.

#### 3. **Practice Platforms and Resources**
- **LeetCode**: 1500+ problems. Focus on Top 100 Liked, Blind 75 (curated for MAANG).
- **Codeforces/AtCoder**: For competitive coding vibes.
- **Interview Prep Books**: "Cracking the Coding Interview" (Gayle Laakmann McDowell), "Elements of Programming Interviews".
- **Videos**: NeetCode (YouTube) for explanations, Striver's DSA sheet.
- **Mock Interviews**: Pramp, LeetCode's mock feature, or with peers.

#### 4. **Extra Tips and Suggestions**
- **Pattern Recognition**: MAANG loves twists on classics (e.g., Tree DP in graphs). Review past interview experiences on Glassdoor or LeetCode Discuss.
- **Coding Style**: Write clean, readable code. Explain your thought process aloud (like in interviews).
- **Time Management**: Easy: 10-15 min, Medium: 20-30 min, Hard: 30-45 min. Use hints sparingly.
- **System Design**: For senior roles, study basics (load balancers, databases) via "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".
- **Behavioral Rounds**: Prepare stories using STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- **Health and Consistency**: Take breaks, journal progress. Consistency > intensity.
- **MAANG-Specific Insights**:
    - Google: Loves algorithms, theory.
    - Amazon: Leadership principles, optimization.
    - Meta: Scalability, graphs.
    - Apple: Clean code, edge cases.
- **Track Progress**: Use Notion or a spreadsheet. Aim for 70%+ solve rate on Medium/Hard.
- **If Stuck**: Watch solutions, but re-solve without looking.
